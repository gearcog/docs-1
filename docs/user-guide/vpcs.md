# VPCs and Namespaces

## VPC

Virtual Private Cloud, similar to the public cloud VPC it provides an isolated private network for the resources with
support for multiple subnets each with user-provided VLANs and on-demand DHCP.

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPC
metadata:
  name: vpc-1
  namespace: default
spec:
  ipv4Namespace: default # Limits to which subnets could be used by VPC to guarantee non-overlapping IPv4 ranges
  vlanNamespace: default # Limits to which switches VPC could be attached to guarantee non-overlapping VLANs
  subnets:
    default: # Each subnet is named
      dhcp: # On-demand DHCP server
        enable: true
        range: # Optionally, start/end range could be specified
          start: 10.10.1.10
      subnet: 10.10.1.0/24 # User-defined subnet from ipv4 namespace
      vlan: "1001" # User-defined VLAN from vlan namespace
    another-subnet: # Minimal configuration is just a name, subnet and VLAN
      subnet: 10.10.100.0/24
      vlan: "1100"
```

## VPCAttachment

Represents a specific VPC subnet assignemnt to the `Connection` object which means exact server port to a VPC binding.
It basically leads to the VPC being available on the specific server port(s) on a subnet VLAN.

VPC could be attached to a switch which is a part of the VLAN namespace used by the VPC.

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPCAttachment
metadata:
  name: vpc-1-server-1--mclag--s5248-01--s5248-02
  namespace: default
spec:
  connection: server-1--mclag--s5248-01--s5248-02 # Connection name representing the server port(s)
  subnet: vpc-1/default # VPC subnet name
```

## VPCPeering

It enables VPC to VPC connectivity. There are tw o types of VPC peering:

* Local - peering is implemented on the same switches where VPCs are attached
* Remote - peering is implemented on the border/mixed leafs defined by the `SwitchGroup` object

VPC peering is only possible between VPCs attached to the same IPv4 namespace.

Local:

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPCPeering
metadata:
  name: vpc-1--vpc-3
  namespace: default
spec:
  permit: # Defines a pair of VPCs to peer
  - vpc-1: {} # meaning all subnets of two VPCs will be able to communicate to each other
    vpc-3: {} # more advanced filtering will be supported in future releases
```

Remote:

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPCPeering
metadata:
  name: vpc-1--vpc-2
  namespace: default
spec:
  permit:
  - vpc-1: {}
    vpc-2: {}
  remote: border # indicates a switch group to implement the peering on
```

## IPv4Namespace

Defines non-overlapping VLAN ranges for attaching servers. Each switch belongs to a list of VLAN namespaces with
non-overlapping VLAN ranges.

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: IPv4Namespace
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  subnets: # List of the subnets that VPCs can pick their subnets from
  - 10.10.0.0/16
```

## VLANNamespace

Defines non-overlapping IPv4 ranges for VPC subnets. Each VPC belongs to a specific IPv4 namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: wiring.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VLANNamespace
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  ranges: # List of VLAN ranges that VPCs can pick their subnet VLANs from
  - from: 1000
    to: 2999
```
